BigHungers is a fullstack food ordering platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides a modern, scalable, and production-ready solution for online food ordering, restaurant management, and real-time order tracking. The project is split into a robust backend REST API and a feature-rich, responsive frontend SPA, both designed for extensibility, modularity, and ease of learning or reuse.

- Modern, responsive UI (React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui)
- City/cuisine search, filtering, and pagination
- Restaurant and menu browsing
- Cart management with quantity controls
- Secure Auth0 authentication (login, logout, protected routes)
- Stripe-powered checkout and payment
- Real-time order status and history
- Admin/owner dashboard for restaurant and order management
- Image upload via Cloudinary
- Toast notifications and loading states
- Modular, reusable code structure (frontend & backend)

---

## Technology Stack

## Backend Overview

- RESTful API for user, restaurant, menu, and order management
- Auth0 JWT authentication middleware
- Stripe integration for payments and webhooks
- Cloudinary for image uploads
- Modular controllers, models, middleware, and routes
- See `food-ordering-backend/README.md` for full backend docs

---

## Frontend Overview

- Responsive SPA with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Auth0 authentication and protected routes
- Stripe checkout integration
- Real-time order status with React Query
- Modular, reusable UI and form components
- See `food-ordering-frontend/README.md` for full frontend docs

---

## API & Routing

- Backend API endpoints are documented in `food-ordering-backend/README.md`
- Frontend routes are managed in `src/AppRoutes.tsx` (React Router v6)
- Example API usage and protected routes are shown in both subproject READMEs

---

## Environment Variables (.env)

Both backend and frontend require their own `.env` files. See the respective subproject README for full details.

### Backend (`food-ordering-backend/.env`)

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your_auth0_audience
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=your_auth0_issuer_base_url
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # or your deployed frontend URL
```

### Frontend (`food-ordering-frontend/.env`)

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:7001 # or your deployed backend URL
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-auth0-audience
VITE_AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:5173/auth-callback # or your deployed frontend URL
```

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-ordering.git
   cd food-ordering
   ```

2. **Set up backend and frontend `.env` files** as described above.
3. **Install dependencies for both projects:**

   ```bash
   cd food-ordering-backend && npm install
   cd ../food-ordering-frontend && npm install
   ```

4. **Start the backend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../food-ordering-backend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd ../food-ordering-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Frontend runs at <http://localhost:5173>, backend at <http://localhost:7001>

## Code Snippets & Reusability

### Example: Backend Auth Middleware

```ts
import { jwtCheck, jwtParse } from "../middleware/auth";
router.get("/protected", jwtCheck, jwtParse, (req, res) => { ... });
```

### Example: Frontend API Hook

```tsx
import { useGetMyOrders } from "@/api/OrderApi";
const { orders, isLoading } = useGetMyOrders();
```

- All controllers, middleware, and components are modular and reusable
- UI primitives and API hooks are decoupled and easy to adapt
